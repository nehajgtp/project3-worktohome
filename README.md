## Setting up React and PSQL
> React
0.  `cd ~/environment && git clone https://github.com/Sresht/lect11/ && cd lect11`
1.  Install your stuff!  
    a)  `npm install`  
    b)  `pip install flask-socketio`  
    c)  `pip install eventlet`  
    d)  `npm install -g webpack`  
    e)  `npm install --save-dev webpack`  
    f)  `npm install socket.io-client --save` 
    g) `pip install googlemaps`
    h) `npm install react-router-dom`
    If you see any error messages, make sure you use  `sudo pip`  or  `sudo npm`. If it says "pip cannot be found", run  `which pip`  and use  `sudo [path to pip from which pip] install`

> Getting PSQL to work with Python

1.  Update yum:  `sudo yum update`, and enter yes to all prompts
2.  Upgrade pip:  `sudo /usr/local/bin/pip install --upgrade pip`
3.  Get psycopg2:  `sudo /usr/local/bin/pip install psycopg2-binary`
4.  Get SQLAlchemy:  `sudo /usr/local/bin/pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy==2.1`

> PSQL

1.  Install PostGreSQL:  `sudo yum install postgresql postgresql-server postgresql-devel postgresql-contrib postgresql-docs`  
    Enter yes to all prompts.
2.  Initialize PSQL database:  `sudo service postgresql initdb`
3.  Start PSQL:  `sudo service postgresql start`
4.  Make a new superuser:  `sudo -u postgres createuser --superuser $USER`  
    If you get an error saying "could not change directory", that's okay! It worked!
5.  Make a new database:  `sudo -u postgres createdb $USER`  
    If you get an error saying "could not change directory", that's okay! It worked!
6.  Make sure your user shows up:  
    a)  `psql`  
    b)  `\du`  look for ec2-user as a user  
    c)  `\l`  look for ec2-user as a database
7.  Make a new user:  
    a)  `psql`  (if you already quit out of psql)
    b) I recommend 4-5 characters - it doesn't have to be very secure. Remember this password!  
    `create user [some_username_here] superuser password '[some_unique_new_password_here]';`  
    c)  `\q`  to quit out of sql
8.  `cd`  into  `lect11`  and make a new file called  `sql.env`  and add  `SQL_USER=`  and  `SQL_PASSWORD=`  in it
9.  Fill in those values with the values you put in 7. b)

## Google Login OAUTH
1. run `npm install react-google-login`
2. Go to https://console.developers.google.com and sign up with personal google account
3. Click "CREATE PROJECT" or in "Select a Project", click "New Project"
4. Name your project.
5. Click "Credentials" and then click "Create Credentials" and click "OAuth client ID"
6. If you see a warning, saying "To create an OAuth client ID, you must first set...", do these steps\
    a) Click "CONFIGURE CONSENT SCREEN"
    b) Choose "External"
    c) Give the application a name and press save.
5. Go to Credentials -> Create Credentials -> OAuth client ID and click "web application"
6. Put the URL of the web app in Authorized JavaScript origins and Authorized redirect URIs\
7. Put your client id in the GoogleButton.jsx file under the scripts folder.

## Setting up API Keys
> Setting up Rapid API
1. Go to https://rapidapi.com/marketplace and create an account (preferably use Github account to create new account).
2. Once new account is created, go to https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/realtor and copy the API key in `X-RapidAPI-Key` to clipboard.
> Setting up Python Client for Google Maps
3. Create a Google account or login to your current Google account.
4. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
5. Click  "Create Credentials" and click on "API Key".
6. Copy API key for the Google API key.
> Create file for API Keys
7. Run `cd project3-worktohome && touch apikeys.env`
8. Open the `apikeys.env` file and enter the following:

    RAPID_API_KEY='YOUR_RAPID_API_KEY'
    GOOGLE_API_KEY='YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY'
9. Install googlemaps dependency  ``` pip install -U googlemaps ```
  

## Enabling read/write from SQLAlchemy

There's a special file that you need to enable your db admin password to work for:

1.  Open the file in vim:  `sudo vim /var/lib/pgsql9/data/pg_hba.conf`  If that doesn't work:  `sudo vim $(psql -c "show hba_file;" | grep pg_hba.conf)`
2.  Replace all values of  `ident`  with  `md5`  in Vim:  `:%s/ident/md5/g`
3.  After changing those lines, run  `sudo service postgresql restart`
4.  Ensure that  `sql.env`  has the username/password of the superuser you created!
5.  Run your code!  
    a)  `npm run watch`. If prompted to install webpack-cli, type "yes"  
    b) In a new terminal,  `python app.py`  
    c) Preview Running Application (might have to clear your cache by doing a hard refresh)

## Unit Testing
Unit Testing\
1. run `pip install coverage`
2. To run all tests, run `coverage run -m --source=. unittest testing/*.py`

## Heroku Deployment
### Heroku Deployment
1. Go to heroku.com and make an account
2. Run `npm install -g heroku` for heroku installation
3. Run the following commands (enter login when prompted to do so):
    a)`heroku login -i`
    b) `heroku create`
    c) `heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev`
    d) `heroku pg:wait`
4. Alter Users
    e) `sudo service postgresql start`
    d) `psql`
    f) `ALTER DATABASE Postgres OWNER TO <your_psql_username>`
    g) `ALTER USER <your_psql_username> WITH CREATEDB CREATEROLE REPLICATION`
    h) `\du`
    i) `\l`
    j) `\q`
5. Push Database to Heroku
    k) `heroku pg:push postgres DATABASE_URL`
    l) `heroku pg:psql`
    m) `select * from message;`
    n) `\q` to exit
6. add the changes to git
7. `touch Procfile && touch requirements.txt`
8. `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
9. `echo "web: python app.py" > Procfile`
10. add and commit Procfile and requiremnts.txt
11. run `npm run build`
11. push to master
12. run `git push heroku master`
13. Check your heroku link to see the deployment!
14. Make sure to add your GOOGLE_API_KEY and RAPID_API_KEY to config variables

### Circle CI CI/CD:
1. Go to https://circleci.com/signup/ and sign up with your github account
2. Authorize and verify the account
3. Make sure you're in the right repo and organization
4. Click on the project and specify that are you're using an existing cirlce config.
5. The one for this project is inside .circleci and claled `config.yml`
6. Go to project settings -> environment variables
7. Create environment variables for HEROKU_API_KEY and HEROKU_APP_NAME, you should \
   be able to find the key in your heroku account.
8. Add environment variables for GOOGLE_API_KEY and HEROKU_APP_NAME
9. Now pushing should start a new build and deploy process
10. If you run into an issue during building with circlci, run `pip freeze > requirements.txt`

## Linting
### app.py
    app.py:34:0: C0413: Import "import models" should be placed at the top of the module (wrong-import-position) : Needs to be in this location to prevent an error according to Kevin.
    app.py:54:8: E1101: Instance of 'query' has no 'filter' member (no-member) : Pylint doesn't detect the method member.
    app.py:89:4: W0603: Using the global statement (global-statement) : Would need an entire overhaul of the email handling to solve.
    app.py:137:17: W1508: os.getenv default type is builtins.int. Expected str or None. (invalid-envvar-default) : It is correct ignore this error. 

### models.py
    models.py:20:4: R0913: Too many arguments (6/5) (too-many-arguments) : It's really close to the max number of arguments and would require a massive overhaul of the application.

    models.py:5:0: W0611: Unused import flask_sqlalchemy (unused-import) : Import is actually nesscary to prevent werid behavior, pylint just does not know this.

### apifunctions.py
    apifunctions.py:66:16: W0622: Redefining built-in 'property' (redefined-builtin): Ali's code.
    apifunctions.py:39:0: R0914: Too many local variables (18/15) (too-many-locals) : Ali's code would require a large refactor.
    apifunctions.py:91:43: W0631: Using possibly undefined loop variable 'property' (undefined-loop-variable) : It is defined. 
    apifunctions.py:109:4: W0612: Unused variable 'out_of_bound' (unused-variable) : Describes the error
    apifunctions.py:39:0: R0912: Too many branches (13/12) (too-many-branches) : Ali's code would require a large refactor.

2. Than must source API keys.
3. Run python app.py
